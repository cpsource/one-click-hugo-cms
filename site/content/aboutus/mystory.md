  What is our founder's story?

# My Story

I started forty-five years ago doing embedded software consulting as an engineer, and have continued ever since.

My business model was simple. I used a contract placement company for sales and found myself working with many companies as an embedded software engineer, eventually specializing in tasks in and around the Linux operating system.

But I began to notice that I was brought on to projects that were in deep trouble. I was the last-chance to save the project, and I often did.

There were patterns to these failures. Hard work alone wouldn't have allowed me to be as successful as I was.

Once I had identified the issue, I could address it and get the project back on track. But, I was poorly placed to effect change. I had come on-board as a software engineer, not as an Software Engineering Organizational Development Expert (O.D.).

Most of my success was due to this O.D. experience, so I've decided to offer my services here and see what comes.

So, I offer my consulting services with these lessons-learned. I estimate it'd take me just a few days on-site to understand your engineering process and what must be done.

I have a Masters in Business Administration ( M.B.A.), a Bachelor of Science (B.S.) in Engineering Physics, and for about fifteen years, was a licensed EMT/Paramedic.

It would be useful for you to read [How We Roll](/aboutus/howweroll/) to understand my audit methodology. I also offer a number of [case studies](http://www.redfireconsultants.org/posts/) to help this methodology become real. This alone
may be enough for you to 'right' your project, but there is an old saying "***A physician that treats himself has a fool for a patient***", so be warned. Smaller projects
can often be done over the phone and/or by video link.

#
#1. Software architecture was poorly though through to such an extent that even the most competent engineer couldn't implement it.
#2. Project management was non-existent or so unbelievably complex that no one could figure out where the project was.
#3. Software engineers were not fully up-to-speed on the technology they were using.
#4. Bad management. For example: I've seen managers call an all-hands meeting and then proceed to berate their engineering staff. Or the project is staffed by hangers-on that contributed nothing but NRE to the# project.
#5. Bad source control strategies. If you don't know where your sources are, you are lost. If you don't use a coherent branch strategy, you are lost.
#6. Agile was over/under implemented.
#7. No QA or QA to be done by the engineer themselves.
#8. Bad client interface. There are two basic models here: the first relies on a specification and price drawn up before engineering begins, and the second is time-and-materials with no fixed price. You get in#to trouble when you mix the two, i.e. a client pays a fixed price but wants constant changes.
