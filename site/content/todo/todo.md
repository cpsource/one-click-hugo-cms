Cal,
 I'm certified in User Experience Design, not web design.  I've reviewed the redfire site, here are my suggestions to improve your usability and user experience:

1.  Articles with a 'Read More' link, change 'read more' to the article title.  'Read More' links will not meet accessibility guidelines.  Along those guidelines be sure all of your images have alt text.  You never know who's using a screen reader!
2.  I'd caution against using red and the red-orange color for text and in general.  Blue is a color that will build trust or if you really want red change to a more maroon color.  Think about financial institutions/organizations that you trust and look at their colors.
3. The wildfire picture is good, change the images on the computer screens to error messages your clients will see and relate to when they're having issues
4. The copy on the contact page seems desperate.  Are you really going to respond immediately?  Not likely- if you are, give a phone number.  I'd expect an immediate response with a call to 911, not an email.  Also get rid of the word 'Just' be as concise as you can be with copy.
5. About Us and Cases-you only have links--you need content on these pages! I'm not expecting to have to click a link to see content after I've just clicked, try to minimize the number of clicks to find info, don't bury it!
6.  Home page- 'what we offer v6'--I don't know what v6 means, will potential clients?  Also there's too much text in this section, you need to make it easier for the eye to scan--bullet points/list format/separate bubbles/etc.
7. Home Page--you have 2 'read more' buttons-name them where they link to, also the active state(when clicked) buttons doesn't seem to have enough contrast
8. Home Page-There's no real visual hierarchy here. What do you want your user to do on this page?  Headings are all the same size, it's not clear where I go from here?  Consider adding a button(like sign up for a consultation, etc.) to direct the user what to do on this page.  Keep your most important info above the fold--I only see the fire image and need to scroll for copy
9. Home Page-clicking on the 'read more' button from 'our values' brings me to a page with only links = bad experience
10. About our founder Page-I suggest moving your credentials to the top of the page as well as contact info.  Also this is very text heavy, know that most people only scan, so consider adding bold to words you want to call attention to--another option have your credentials, contact info, very brief summary and a link to the full story.  This is your business and you need to build trust, I suggest adding a current photo to the founder page, and relevant social handles where you post-twitter, github, reddit, instagram, linked in, etc. this is so people can verify who you are.
11.General comments-I'm not sure how the coffee imagery fits in with this site, there's illustrations and photographs depicting espresso/coffee, favicon is a mug--your business is fixing software issues. Is there a connection I'm missing here?
12.General comments-Fonts-the main heading font has kerning that is too close and may affect readability(f's and t's blend together), consider choosing a different font.  Poppins is a great sans serif font similar to what you chose.  Also the font for 'redfire' doesn't work well with the font you currently have.  You can use a sans serif for headings and serif for body, and vice versa depending on what style you're going for.  This is a great site to try out font combos-google's design guidelines:

13. Dating your articles is good, it helps show your content is trustworthy, your font size for the date should be smaller (10pt min) and consider eliminating the read time.  Check out NPR.org they're known for great UX, model your article format after theirs.
14.  The site is not mobile friendly, these days everything should be
15.  Your footer seems quite large for the content in there.  I'd also consider a different background color--black and white backgrounds together aren't great for visibility.  Typically you use one of your main colors in the footer, I wouldn't recommend the red/orange, if you change to something less alarming use it as the background in the footer.  If you really want a dark color use a lighter version like a dark gray.  This site does a good job of using orange and gray, https://www.reserveamerica.com  But red will generally evoke emotions of danger/fear and orange is often used/associated with adventure/outdoors products.  

As I only do the designing, not the coding, I use figma.  The free version allows for collab with 1 other person on 1 project.  The css can be exported from figma and some of the IOS/Android specific code. No idea about all the others you mentioned.  I know webflow is always recommended for site building and Notion is a free option, not sure if you can collab with notion.
